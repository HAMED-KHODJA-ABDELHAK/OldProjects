Hi.

Find the documentation in a doc in this folder.

In order to run the project, open Eclipse and import all three projects from the top. Note, I do NOT use the RMI plugin. Just stock java.

Next ensure that the Java JRE or an equivalent is available in the project, latest java 6 or 7 should work.

Then simply start up ServerStarter first and then start any of the client test cases under drs.client.

That's it.
