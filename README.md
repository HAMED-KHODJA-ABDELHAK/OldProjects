Overview
========

This is a repo of interesting code I've worked on over the years.

It is mainly experiments with programming algorithms, interesting tech or just stuff I might reuse. People are free to take what they will
not all code is up to my latest standards as I've evolved as I wrote it though most has some interesting stuff.

mpi: Contains some cluster programming I did during university. See readme inside.

data_structs: Contains implementations of some common datastructs including trees, heaps and graphs in Java.
