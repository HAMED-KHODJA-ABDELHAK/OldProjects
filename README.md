These programs were designed to run on a cluster, I believe you can run them locally by using openMPI. These come with no warranty, use as is.

Both A1 and A2 work perfectly.
I started A3 a little late so I submitted not perfectly running code.

Some people may find the MPI code interesting, shows how to use Makefiles to compile C and use Cunit as unit testing. I personally liked this course quite a bit.
