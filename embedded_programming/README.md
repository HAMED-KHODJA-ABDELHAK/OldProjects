EmbeddedSystems
==================

This was embedded programming course for learning C programming techniques and experimenting
with controlling boards using low level techniques like PWM for signals and other stuff. 
Early labs concern C control of an arduino board to make motors on a car go.

Later project involves an arducopter that was driven by signals from a terminal over wifi.
We also managed to hookup a webcam and stream images back to our pc though it was unreliable due to interference
at the site.
Nice interesting stuff. Should get one of these hobby boards for tinkering.


Code was done with Jaspreet Lidder, he has a copy of the code on github as well.
