Special notes on running:

1) Edit the String[] args array in src/corba/client/ClientBase.java to match the hostname of the PC.

2) Add arguments to corba.server.CorbaStarter.java that match these args.

3) I've left some logs in the zip, doesn't impact the demos. You can clean all except the V4500x logs used in the exchange demo.
