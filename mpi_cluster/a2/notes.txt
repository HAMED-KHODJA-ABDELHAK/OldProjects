We can recursively use the bit positions to pair.
Those with lower bit in lower cube, those with higher bit in higher cube.
Lower pairs send higher pivot portion to other partner. Same for higher.
After log(n) recursions we will have the sorted list at each processor.
Merge the lists to p0 and write to output.

Use get_count in the case where we are exchanging data, so in the 
case where we send and recv in a dimensional exchange.
